<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Red velvet cake is a red colored layer cake with cream cheese or ermine icing. The origin of the cake is unknown, although it is popular in the Southern United States and has been served as a dessert at New York City's Waldorf-Astoria hotel since the 1920s. Both the hotel and Eaton's in Canada claim to have developed the recipe.

Ingredients of the cake include baking powder, butter, buttermilk or vinegar, cocoa powder, eggs, flour, salt, vanilla extract, and in most modern recipes, red food coloring.

The cake lost popularity after Red Dye #2 was linked to cancer in the 1970s. In the late 20th century, the cake regained popularity in the United States to the point that other food products were being made to mimic the flavor and other consumer products were being made to mimic the scent.</p>
<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>Chef Pamela Moxley's beetroot variation has beetroot, lemon juice, and goat cheese as additional components. According to the variation's recipe, beetroots are chopped to the size of sliced onions and added to the batter, while lemon juice is used to tint the batter red; goat cheese is combined with the cream cheese icing.[12] Other cake variations include red velvet bundt cake, doberge cake, ice cream cake and cheesecake.[13] Non-cake alternatives of red velvet cake include red velvet cookies, brownies, cinnamon rolls, lattes, teas, waffles, Pop-Tarts, and sundaes. The flavor has also been used in protein powders and vodka and the scent in candles and air fresheners.</p>

<p>The batter is made by first creaming together butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract. Separately, cocoa powder and red food coloring are combined and then integrated into the mixture. The remaining ingredients are then added, mixed, and blended. After pouring the batter into a cake pan, the cake is baked for 20 to 25 minutes and cooled before adding icing between the layers. Most modern recipes call for a cream cheese frosting, but some recipes call for ermine icing.</p>
