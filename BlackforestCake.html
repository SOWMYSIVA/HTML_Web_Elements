<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>Black Forest gateau,[a] (German: Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte [ˈʃvaʁt͡svɛldɐ ˈkɪʁʃˌtɔʁtə] ⓘ, lit. 'Black Forest cherry torte') or Black Forest cake, is a layer cake made out of cocoa powder, cherries, Kirsch, and whipped cream, with dark chocolate as a decoration. The origins of the cake and its name are disputed. However, the cake's recipe from 1927 is kept at an archive in Radolfzell, Germany. Black Forest gateau became popular in the second half of the 20th century and is now featured internationally in cafés and restaurants. A festival dedicated to the cake is organised in Todtnauberg. The cake also appeared in the 2007 video game Portal.</p>
<h2><b>History</b></h2>
<p>The origin of Black Forest gateau is disputed.[2][3] The earliest known publication of the term Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte was in February 1915 in Brandenburg an der Havel.[4] The confectioner Josef Keller [de] (1887–1981) claimed in 1975 to have made Black Forest gateau while working at a café in Bad Godesberg.[5][2] His son asserted about 1982 that Keller had invented the cake in 1915, though it is known that he could not have come to Bad Godesberg until after April 1915.[4] He made the cake by mixing Kirsch schnapps, a cherry brandy, whipped cream, and cherries. Keller continued to serve the cake at his café after relocating to Radolfzell.[2][6] Udo Rauch, the city archivist of Tübingen, cited the pastry chef Erwin Hildenbrand as having invented the cake in 1930. Although the origin of the cake's name is similarly disputed,[7] the food writer Ursula Heinzelmann claims that it comes from the cake's resemblance to the Black Forest region's black, white, and red costume.[2] According to a different theory, the cherries on the cake are supposed to resemble bollenhut headwear.</p>
