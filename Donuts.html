<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A doughnut is a type of pastry made from leavened fried dough.  It is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors.

Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, but other types of batters can also be used. Various toppings and flavors are used for different types, such as sugar, chocolate or maple glazing. Doughnuts may also include water, leavening, eggs, milk, sugar, oil, shortening, and natural or artificial flavors.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h4>Early History</h4>
<p>A recipe for a deep-fried dough ball was recorded by Cato the Elder in his De agri cultura, using cheese, honey, and poppy seeds, called globi. Similar types of fried dough recipes have either spread to, or originated, in other parts of Europe and the World.

A 13th-century Arabic cookbook, written by Ibn Razīn al-Tujībī contains a recipe for a doughnut-like variant of sfenj, made by frying leavened semolina dough, the dough is meant to be shaped into a small ball, the recipe also calls for shaping the dough into a Ka'ak with a hole in the middle to test its proofing. This is done before frying the first batch and results in a shape reminiscent of a modern doughnut.</p>
<h4>England and North America</h4>
<p>Dutch settlers brought olykoek ("oil(y) cake") to New York (or New Amsterdam) in the early 18th century. These doughnuts closely resembled later ones but did not yet have their current ring shape.

A recipe for fried dough "nuts" was published, in 1750 England, under the title "How to make Hertfordshire Cakes, Nuts and Pincushions", in The Country Housewife’s Family Companion by William Ellis.</p>
