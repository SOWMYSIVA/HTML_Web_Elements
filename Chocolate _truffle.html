<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The cake itself is dense and moist, just like proper chocolate cake should be, and the frosting…. oh that frosting! Pure chocolate heaven! It’s simple, consisting of chocolate, heavy cream, and butter, which is basically how you make a chocolate truffle, albeit with slightly different proportions. It is dreamy chocolate heaven right there.</p>

<p>Easy to make - the cake can be made in one bowl with a whisk, so you don't need a mixer. You can also whip the cream by hand, although I often use my electric hand mixer to do it faster.</p>
