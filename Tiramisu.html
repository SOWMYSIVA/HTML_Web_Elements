<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Tiramisu[a] is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cuisine" target="_blank">Italian</a>
 dessert made of ladyfinger pastries (savoiardi) dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of egg yolks, sugar, and mascarpone, and topped with cocoa powder. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts. Its origin is disputed between the Italian regions of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The name comes from the Italian tirami su (lit. 'pick me up' or 'cheer me up').</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tiramisu appears to have been invented in the late 1960s or early 1970s, but where and when exactly is unclear. Some believe the recipe was derived from sbatudin, a simpler dessert made of egg yolks and sugar. Others argue it originated from another dish, dolce Torino.</p>
<p>The tiramisu recipe is not found in cookbooks before the 1960s.It is mentioned in a Sydney Morning Herald restaurant column published in 1978.[10] It is not mentioned in encyclopaedias and dictionaries of the 1970s, first appearing in an Italian dictionary in 1980, and in English in 1982. It is mentioned in a 1983 cookbook devoted to cooking of the Veneto region.</p>
<h2>Original ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li> ladyfingers </li>
<li>egg yolks</li>
<li>sugar</li>
<li>coffee</li>
<li>mascarpone</li>
<li>cocoa powder</li>

</ul>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>The original shape of the cake is round, although the shape of the biscuits also allows the use of a rectangular or square pan. Tiramisu is often assembled in round glasses, which show the various layers, or pyramids. Modern versions can have the addition of whipped cream or whipped egg whites, or both, combined with mascarpone. This makes the dish lighter, thick and foamy. Another variation involves the preparation of the cream with eggs heated just enough to pasteurize the mixture without scrambling the eggs. The cake is usually eaten cold.</p>
<p>Numerous variations of tiramisu exist. Many replace the coffee with other ingredients such as chocolate, amaretto, lemon, strawberry, pineapple, yoghurt, banana, raspberry, and coconut. Some cooks use other cakes or sweet, yeasted bread, such as panettone, in place of ladyfingers (savoiardi). Bakers living in different Italian regions often debate the use and structural qualities of utilising other types of cookies, such as pavesini for instance, in the recipe. Other cheese mixtures are used as well, some containing raw eggs, and others containing no eggs at all.

Alcohol can be added to either the coffee or the cheese mixture. Common choices include Marsala wine, dark rum, Madeira, port, brandy, Malibu or Irish cream and especially coffee-flavoured liqueurs such as Tia Maria and Kahlúa.</p>
