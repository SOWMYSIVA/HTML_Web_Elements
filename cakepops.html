<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A cake pop is a form of cake styled as a lollipop. Cake crumbs are mixed with icing or chocolate, and formed into small spheres or cubes in the same way as cake balls, before being given a coating of icing, chocolate or other decorations and attached to lollipop sticks.[1] Cake pops can be a way of using up leftover cake or cake crumbs.</p>
<p>They are often beautifully decorated with sprinkles, nuts, candy, powdered sugar and other amazing decorations. Cake Pops are the perfect combination of sweet and indulgent; each one offers a unique combination of flavor and texture that will tantalize your taste buds. Whether you prefer a classic like vanilla cake mixed with cream cheese and topped with white chocolate and cake crumbs. Or a creative one, like a chocolate cake mixed with chocolate buttercream frosting, topped with a colorful melted candy melt. These little beauties are sure to make a statement and bring a smile to everyoneâ€™s face.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origin of cake pops dates back to 2008 when a Los Angeles-based cake decorator, Bakerella, mixed a cake with frosting and formed it into little balls, and stuck a stick into them, so they looked like lollypops. Since then, the popularity of cake pops has been steadily growing. Cake pops have been trending in the baking community, thanks to Bakerella who became a sensation when her creations were featured in food magazines and blogs. Since then, cake pops have evolved in popularity and have even made their way into mainstream bakeries and candy stores. Today, cake pops come in a huge variety of flavors, from chocolate to vanilla. Not only do cake pops make a great snack for parties and gatherings, but they also make perfect gifts for birthdays and special holidays.</p>
